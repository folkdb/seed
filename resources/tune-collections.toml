title = "The Traditional Tune Archive"
description = "Large searchable index and repository growing out of a dedicated amateur's decades-long project to classify and trace the genealogy of fiddle tunes recorded/collected in the British Isles and North America.  The current version is maintained as a Wiki, allowing for collaborative editing, powerful search capabilities, and a familiar interface. This is a one-of-a-kind resource for dance tunes and airs (as contrasted with lyric songs and ballads, which have been systematically catalogued elsewhere). Entries include classification of meter, tonality, and structure, citations of print sources and recordings, alternate titles, geographic distribution, and music transcriptions rendered from ABC notation."

description = "As described: \"a searchable collection of tunes in ABC Music Notation format . . . and associated supporting bio and documentary material\". Audio files for some of the tunes can be located on another part of the site. Pages load slowly from a US East Coast location, likely because data is being transmitted from a server in Australia."
